    "\n",
    "NumPy is a Python package which stands for ‘Numerical Python’. It is an extension module for Python, mostly written in C. This makes sure that the precompiled mathematical and numerical functions and functionalities of NumPy guarantee great execution speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, NumPy enriches the programming language Python with powerful data structures, implementing multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. These data structures guarantee efficient calculations with matrices and arrays. The implementation is even aiming at huge matrices and arrays, better known under the heading of \"big data\". Besides that, the module supplies a large library of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these matrices and arrays."
