    "This jupyter notebook contains information explaining Digit recognition Python script. Iâ€™ll  discuss what technologies were used in the script and step by step how it works with explanations and samples of code. Also describe in brief what is neural network, popular classification of algorithms used  to recognize handwritten numbers.The  goal of this notebook is to show how to recognize handwritten digit using a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) in Keras and how to build a near state-of-the-art deep neural network model using Python and Keras."

    "### 2. What is a neural network?\n",
    "A neural network is a type of machine learning which models itself after the human brain. This creates an artificial neural network that via an algorithm allows the computer to learn by incorporating new data.The computer with the neural network is taught to do a task by having it analyze training examples, which have been previously labeled in advance. A common example of a task for a neural network using deep learning is an object recognition task, where the neural network is presented with a large number of objects of a certain type, such as a cat, or a street sign, and the computer, by analyzing the recurring patterns in the presented images, learns to categorize new images."

    "### 2.1 How a deep learning neural network learns?\n",
    "A multilayer perceptron (MLP) has one or more hidden layers along with the input and output layers, each layer contains several neurons that interconnect with each other by weight links. The number of neurons in the input layer will be the number of attributes in the dataset, neurons in the output layer will be the number of classes given in the dataset.For a basic idea of how a deep learning neural network learns, imagine a factory line. After the raw materials (the data set) are input, they are then passed down the conveyer belt, with each subsequent stop or layer extracting a different set of high-level features. If the network is intended to recognize an object, the first layer might analyze the brightness of its pixels.The next layer could then identify any edges in the image, based on lines of similar pixels. After this, another layer may recognize textures and shapes, and so on. By the time the fourth or fifth layer is reached, the deep learning net will have created complex feature detectors. \n",
